# package-manager-app

### This is a complex project. It is about the connection between client side and server side. 
### On the server side we have a list of packages. On the client side we have the possibility to add, update or delete a package. All the changes that the user does on the client side are also process on the server side.

### We learn about web form in HTML and client-server connection.
